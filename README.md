# Stellar-Classification-Model

The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies different types of celestial objects. Using machine learning techniques, the project demonstrates how data from SDSS can be processed, analyzed, and used to train a classifier that distinguishes between stars, galaxies, and quasars. The project includes data extraction, preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation steps to achieve high classification accuracy.
